## ðŸ’¡ **Problem Explanation**

The problem requires us to determine the number of unique leads and partners for each date and make name combination from a table called `DailySales`. In simpler terms, we want to know how many different lead IDs and partner IDs appear for each unique combination of date and make name.

**Sample Input:**

Consider a simplified `DailySales` table:

| date_id    | make_name | lead_id | partner_id |
|------------|-----------|---------|------------|
| 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
| 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 0       | 2          |
| 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 1       | 2          |
| 2020-12-07 | toyota    | 0       | 2          |
| 2020-12-07 | honda     | 1       | 2          |
| 2020-12-07 | honda     | 2       | 2          |
| 2020-12-08 | honda     | 1       | 1          |

**Expected Output:**

| date_id    | make_name | unique_leads | unique_partners |
|------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 2020-12-07 | honda     | 2            | 1               |
| 2020-12-07 | toyota    | 1            | 1               |
| 2020-12-08 | honda     | 1            | 1               |
| 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 2            | 2               |

## ðŸ“Š **Algorithm**

*   **Group by Date and Make Name**: Group the rows based on `date_id` and `make_name` to aggregate data for each unique combination.
*   **Count Unique Leads**: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id)` to count the number of unique lead IDs within each group.
*   **Count Unique Partners**: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id)` to count the number of unique partner IDs within each group.
*   **Select and Display**: Select the `date_id`, `make_name`, the count of unique leads, and the count of unique partners.

## ðŸ”¥ **Code Implementation**

```mysql
SELECT date_id,make_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(LEAD_ID)) AS unique_leads,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(PARTNER_ID)) AS unique_partners
FROM DAILYSALES
GROUP BY DATE_ID,MAKE_NAME
```

## ðŸ“Š **ASCII Representation**

Here's a simplified ASCII representation of the `DailySales` table:

```
DailySales Table
+------------+-----------+---------+------------+
| date_id    | make_name | lead_id | partner_id |
+------------+-----------+---------+------------+
| 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
| 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 0       | 2          |
| ...        | ...       | ...     | ...        |
+------------+-----------+---------+------------+
```

## ðŸ“Š **WORKING**

Let's walk through how the SQL query processes the sample input.

1.  **Initial Table:**

    ```
    DailySales Table
    +------------+-----------+---------+------------+
    | date_id    | make_name | lead_id | partner_id |
    +------------+-----------+---------+------------+
    | 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
    | 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 0       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 1       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-07 | toyota    | 0       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-07 | honda     | 1       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-07 | honda     | 2       | 2          |
    | 2020-12-08 | honda     | 1       | 1          |
    +------------+-----------+---------+------------+
    ```

2.  **Grouping:** The query groups the rows by `date_id` and `make_name`. This results in the following groups:

    *   Group 1: `date_id` = '2020-12-08', `make_name` = 'toyota'
        *   Rows: (`2020-12-08`, `toyota`, `0`, `1`), (`2020-12-08`, `toyota`, `0`, `2`), (`2020-12-08`, `toyota`, `1`, `2`)
    *   Group 2: `date_id` = '2020-12-07', `make_name` = 'toyota'
        *   Rows: (`2020-12-07`, `toyota`, `0`, `2`)
    *   Group 3: `date_id` = '2020-12-07', `make_name` = 'honda'
        *   Rows: (`2020-12-07`, `honda`, `1`, `2`), (`2020-12-07`, `honda`, `2`, `2`)
    *   Group 4: `date_id` = '2020-12-08', `make_name` = 'honda'
        *   Rows: (`2020-12-08`, `honda`, `1`, `1`)

3.  **Counting Unique Leads and Partners:** For each group, the query counts the distinct `lead_id` and `partner_id`.

    *   Group 1 ('2020-12-08', 'toyota'):
        *   Unique leads: `0`, `1` (count = 2)
        *   Unique partners: `1`, `2` (count = 2)
    *   Group 2 ('2020-12-07', 'toyota'):
        *   Unique leads: `0` (count = 1)
        *   Unique partners: `2` (count = 1)
    *   Group 3 ('2020-12-07', 'honda'):
        *   Unique leads: `1`, `2` (count = 2)
        *   Unique partners: `2` (count = 1)
    *   Group 4 ('2020-12-08', 'honda'):
        *   Unique leads: `1` (count = 1)
        *   Unique partners: `1` (count = 1)

4.  **Final Output:**

    | date_id    | make_name | unique_leads | unique_partners |
    |------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
    | 2020-12-07 | honda     | 2            | 1               |
    | 2020-12-07 | toyota    | 1            | 1               |
    | 2020-12-08 | honda     | 1            | 1               |
    | 2020-12-08 | toyota    | 2            | 2               |

## ðŸš€ **Time & Space Complexity**

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is **O(N)**, where N is the number of rows in the `DailySales` table.  This is because the query needs to scan each row to perform the grouping and counting operations.  The `COUNT(DISTINCT)` operation can add some overhead, but it is generally efficient due to database optimizations (e.g., using hash tables).
*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **O(G)**, where G is the number of unique groups (combinations of `date_id` and `make_name`).  This is because the database needs to store intermediate results for each group during the aggregation process. In the worst-case scenario, if each row forms a unique group, the space complexity could approach O(N), but typically G << N.
