## ðŸ’¡ **Problem Explanation**

The problem requires you to group sold products by the date they were sold.  Specifically, you need to find the number of distinct products sold on each date and list those products in alphabetical order, separated by commas.

**Example:**

Imagine you have a table like this:

| sell_date  | product |
|------------|---------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil    |
| 2020-05-30 | Mask      |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball|
| 2020-06-01 | Headphone |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil    |
| 2020-06-01 | Smartphone|

The expected output should be:

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                      |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,Mask      |
| 2020-06-01 | 3        | Headphone,Pencil,Smartphone   |

## ðŸ“Š **Algorithm**

*   Group the rows by `sell_date`.
*   Count the number of distinct `product` within each group.
*   Concatenate the distinct `product` names into a comma-separated string, ordered alphabetically.
*   Order the result by `sell_date`.

## ðŸ”¥ **Code Implementation**

```mysql
SELECT sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(PRODUCT)) AS "num_sold",
    GROUP_CONCAT(
        -- U DONT NEED TO MENTION 'SELECT'
        DISTINCT PRODUCT
        ORDER BY PRODUCT
        SEPARATOR ",") AS "products"
FROM ACTIVITIES
GROUP BY SELL_DATE
ORDER BY SELL_DATE
```

## ðŸ“Š **WORKING**

Let's trace the execution with the sample input provided in the problem explanation.

**Input Table (ACTIVITIES):**

| sell_date  | product     |
|------------|-------------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-05-30 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-01 | Smartphone  |

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1.  **`GROUP BY SELL_DATE`:**  The table is grouped into two groups: `2020-05-30` and `2020-06-01`.

2.  **`COUNT(DISTINCT(PRODUCT)) AS "num_sold"`:**
    *   For `2020-05-30`, the distinct products are "Headphone", "Mask", and "Basketball". Count = 3.
    *   For `2020-06-01`, the distinct products are "Pencil", "Headphone", and "Smartphone". Count = 3.

3.  **`GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT PRODUCT ORDER BY PRODUCT SEPARATOR ",") AS "products"`:**
    *   For `2020-05-30`, the distinct products are concatenated into "Basketball,Headphone,Mask" (alphabetically sorted).
    *   For `2020-06-01`, the distinct products are concatenated into "Headphone,Pencil,Smartphone" (alphabetically sorted).

4.  **`ORDER BY SELL_DATE`:**  The result is already ordered by sell\_date in ascending order, since the dates given in the input data.

**Final Output:**

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                      |
|------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,Mask      |
| 2020-06-01 | 3        | Headphone,Pencil,Smartphone   |

## ðŸš€ **Time & Space Complexity**

*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is dominated by the `GROUP BY` operation and the `GROUP_CONCAT` function. In the worst case, if all rows have the same `sell_date`, `GROUP_CONCAT` might take **O(N log N)** time to sort the products, where N is the number of rows.  The `COUNT(DISTINCT)` operation also contributes to the time complexity, potentially adding another **O(N)** factor depending on the database implementation. Therefore, the overall time complexity is approximately **O(N log N)**.

*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is primarily determined by the space required to store the intermediate grouped results and the concatenated strings. In the worst-case scenario, where all products are distinct for a given date, the space complexity for `GROUP_CONCAT` could be **O(N)** to store the concatenated string. Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(N)**.
