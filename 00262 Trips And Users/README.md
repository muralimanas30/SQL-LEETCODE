## üí° Problem Statement

Given two tables, `Trips` and `Users`, calculate the **cancellation rate** for each day between `'2013-10-01'` and `'2013-10-03'`. The cancellation rate is the number of cancelled trips divided by the total number of trips for each day. **Exclude** trips where either the client or the driver is a banned user.

## üß≠ SQL Approach Overview

- **Filtering:** Only trips between the specified dates and with non-banned users are considered.
- **Cancelled Trips:** Count trips where the status starts with `'cancelled_by_'`.
- **Total Trips:** Count all valid trips per day.
- **Cancellation Rate:** Divide cancelled by total trips, rounding to two decimals.
- **Why this approach?**  
  Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) makes the logic modular and readable, and allows for easy aggregation and joining.

## ü™ú Step-by-Step Solution Breakdown

1. **COUNT_OF_CANCEL:**  
   - Join `Trips` with `Users` (clients and drivers).
   - Filter for non-banned users and status like `'cancelled_by_%'`.
   - Group by day and count cancelled trips.

2. **COUNT_OF_TOTAL:**  
   - Join `Trips` with `Users` (clients and drivers).
   - Filter for non-banned users.
   - Group by day and count total trips.

3. **Final SELECT:**  
   - Left join total trips with cancelled trips by day.
   - Calculate cancellation rate using `IFNULL` to handle days with zero cancellations.
   - Round the result to two decimal places.

## üíª MySQL Code Implementation

WITH COUNT_OF_CANCEL AS (
    SELECT 
        T.REQUEST_AT AS DAY,
        COUNT(*) AS CANCELLED
    FROM TRIPS T
    JOIN USERS U1 ON T.CLIENT_ID = U1.USERS_ID
    JOIN USERS U2 ON T.DRIVER_ID = U2.USERS_ID
    WHERE T.STATUS LIKE 'cancelled_by_%'
      AND U1.BANNED = 'No'
      AND U2.BANNED = 'No'
      AND T.REQUEST_AT BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
    GROUP BY T.REQUEST_AT

        IFNULL(C_TOTAL.TOTAL_TRIPS,0), 2)
        AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM COUNT_OF_TOTAL C_TOTAL
LEFT JOIN COUNT_OF_CANCEL C_CANCEL ON C_TOTAL.DAY = C_CANCEL.DAY;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Programming Workflow

### Numbered Steps

1. Filter out banned users from both clients and drivers.
2. Count cancelled trips per day (`COUNT_OF_CANCEL`).
3. Count total trips per day (`COUNT_OF_TOTAL`).
4. Left join total trips with cancelled trips by day.
5. Calculate and round the cancellation rate.

## üöÄ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is dominated by the joins and group by operations. Assuming the size of the `Trips` table is *T* and the size of the `Users` table is *U*, the joins will take O(T \* U) in the worst case, but with indexes on `USERS_ID`, the lookups would be faster. The `GROUP BY` operation would be approximately O(T log T). Therefore, the overall time complexity would be roughly **O(T log T)**, considering indexes.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is determined by the size of the intermediate tables created by the CTEs (`COUNT_OF_CANCEL` and `COUNT_OF_TOTAL`). In the worst case, these tables could have a size proportional to the number of distinct days in the `Trips` table, leading to **O(D)** where D is the number of distinct days within the specified range (in this case, a maximum of 3).
