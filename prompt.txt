I have a README for a LeetCode problem solution (MySQL implementation). I want you to generate a much more professional, comprehensive markdown README, without modifying the MySQL code. The improved README should include:
An external link to the platform for this question
A clear and concise problem statement.
Well-formatted example inputs (table schemas and sample data) and outputs. Include the stats etc already present.
An overview of the SQL approach used, including why it was chosen.
A detailed explanation of all tables, columns, and any temporary tables or subqueries used (with a table if appropriate).
Step-by-step breakdown of the SQL solution.
Visual diagrams to illustrate table relationships or query flows (ASCII art or tables).
A step-by-step walkthrough of the SQL query on a sample input.
The MySQL code implementation (unchanged).
A Programming Workflow section that outlines the logical flow of the SQL solution, both as a numbered list and as a flowchart (ASCII art).
Complexity analysis (time and space, if applicable).
References to relevant SQL concepts or external resources.
